# TEXT PROCESSING LEVEL-1
->> Tokeization : Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters. Tokenization is essential because it prepares the text for further processing and analysis.

-->   **Types of Tokenization**

#Word Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.

#Subword Tokenization: Splitting text into smaller units like subwords or morphemes.

#Character Tokenization: Splitting text into individual characters.

-->   Tokenization Techniques

#Whitespace Tokenization: Splits the text based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).

#Punctuation-based Tokenization: Splits the text based on punctuation marks.

#Regex Tokenization: Uses regular expressions to define patterns for splitting the text.

#Library-based Tokenization: Utilizes specialized libraries that implement advanced tokenization algorithms.
