# TEXT PROCESSING LEVEL-1
->>   **Tokeization :**  Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters. Tokenization is essential because it prepares the text for further processing and analysis.

-->   **Types of Tokenization**

#Word Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.

#Subword Tokenization: Splitting text into smaller units like subwords or morphemes.

#Character Tokenization: Splitting text into individual characters.

-->   **Tokenization Techniques**

#Whitespace Tokenization: Splits the text based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).

#Punctuation-based Tokenization: Splits the text based on punctuation marks.

#Regex Tokenization: Uses regular expressions to define patterns for splitting the text.

#Library-based Tokenization: Utilizes specialized libraries that implement advanced tokenization algorithms.

--> **Lemmatization Techniques**

Lemmatization techniques in natural language processing (NLP) involve methods to identify and transform words into their base or root forms, known as lemmas. These approaches contribute to text normalization, facilitating more accurate language analysis and processing in various NLP applications. Three types of lemmatization techniques are:

1. Rule Based Lemmatization:Rule-based lemmatization involves the application of predefined rules to derive the base or root form of a word. Unlike machine learning-based approaches, which learn from data, rule-based lemmatization relies on linguistic rules and patterns.
Here’s a simplified example of rule-based lemmatization for English verbs:
Rule: For regular verbs ending in “-ed,” remove the “-ed” suffix.
Example:
                  Word: “walked”
                  Rule Application: Remove “-ed”
                  Result: “walk
This approach extends to other verb conjugations, providing a systematic way to obtain lemmas for regular verbs. While rule-based lemmatization may not cover all linguistic nuances, it serves as a transparent and interpretable method for deriving base forms in many cases.

2. Dictionary-Based Lemmatization:Dictionary-based lemmatization relies on predefined dictionaries or lookup tables to map words to their corresponding base forms or lemmas. Each word is matched against the dictionary entries to find its lemma. This method is effective for languages with well-defined rules.
Suppose we have a dictionary with lemmatized forms for some words:

                                                                          ‘running’ -> ‘run’
                                                                          ‘better’ -> ‘good’
                                                                          ‘went’ -> ‘go’
When we apply dictionary-based lemmatization to a text like “I was running to become a better athlete, and then I went home,” the resulting lemmatized form would be: “I was run to become a good athlete, and then I go home.”

3. Machine Learning-Based Lemmatization: Machine learning-based lemmatization leverages computational models to automatically learn the relationships between words and their base forms. Unlike rule-based or dictionary-based approaches, machine learning models, such as neural networks or statistical models, are trained on large text datasets to generalize patterns in language.
Example: Consider a machine learning-based lemmatizer trained on diverse texts. When encountering the word ‘went,’ the model, having learned patterns, predicts the base form as ‘go.’ Similarly, for ‘happier,’ the model deduces ‘happy’ as the lemma. The advantage lies in the model’s ability to adapt to varied linguistic nuances and handle irregularities, making it robust for lemmatizing diverse vocabularies.


-->  **Stopwords in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 

-> Introduction
Stopwords are common words in a language that are usually filtered out in the preprocessing step of text data analysis. These words are considered to have little to no semantic value in the context of information retrieval and natural language processing tasks. Examples of stopwords in English include "the," "is," "in," "and," "to," etc.

-> Importance in NLP
The primary goal of removing stopwords is to reduce the dimensionality of the text data and to focus on the words that carry more significant meaning and context. By excluding stopwords, NLP models can perform more efficiently and accurately, especially in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

-> Common Stopword Lists
Different libraries and tools offer predefined lists of stopwords for various languages. Some of the commonly used libraries include:

--) NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit provides extensive support for stopwords in multiple languages.
--) spaCy: Another popular library that offers built-in stopword lists for many languages.
--) scikit-learn: Provides a basic list of English stopwords that can be used with text vectorizers.

--> Customizing Stopwords
Depending on the application, the predefined stopword lists might need to be customized. Customization can involve:

--> Adding Words: Specific words that are frequent in the given context but do not carry significant meaning can be added to the stopword list.
--> Removing Words: Some words in the predefined lists might be relevant to the particular application and should not be removed.

n Natural Language Processing (NLP), POS stands for Part of Speech. It refers to the grammatical categories into which words are classified based on their syntactic roles within sentences. Understanding the POS of words is essential for various NLP tasks, as it helps in parsing sentences, understanding context, and improving the accuracy of language models.


--> **Parts OF Speech**

**Common Parts of Speech:**
--Noun (NN): Represents a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., dog, London, love).
--Verb (VB): Indicates an action, event, or state (e.g., run, is, think).
--Adjective (JJ): Describes or modifies a noun (e.g., blue, quick, tall).
--Adverb (RB): Modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., quickly, very, well).
--Pronoun (PRP): Replaces a noun (e.g., he, she, it).
--Preposition (IN): Shows the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and other words in a sentence (e.g., in, on, at).
--Conjunction (CC): Connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or).
--Determiner (DT): Introduces a noun and provides context (e.g., the, a, some).
--Interjection (UH): Expresses strong emotion or reaction (e.g., wow, oh, ouch).

**Importance of POS Tagging in NLP:**

--> Text Parsing: Helps in breaking down a sentence into its grammatical components, making it easier to analyze the structure.
--> Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names of people, places, etc., often relies on accurate POS tagging.
--> Sentiment Analysis: Understanding whether a word is an adjective, verb, or noun can help determine the sentiment expressed.
--> Machine Translation: Correctly translating a sentence requires an understanding of the roles each word plays.
--> Speech Recognition: Identifying and correctly interpreting words based on their function.

--> *POS Tagging:*
POS tagging is the process of labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech. This can be done using rule-based methods, statistical models, or machine learning techniques, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), or deep learning models.


**1. Rule-Based POS Tagging**
Description: Rule-based taggers use a set of hand-crafted linguistic rules to assign POS tags. These rules consider the word itself, its suffixes or prefixes, and its context within the sentence.
Example: A rule might state, "If a word ends in '-ing' and is preceded by a form of the verb 'to be,' tag it as a verb (VBG)."

**2. Statistical POS Tagging**
Description: Statistical taggers use probabilities derived from large annotated corpora to determine the most likely POS tag for a word in a given context. Common statistical models include Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Maximum Entropy models.
**--Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):**
Description: HMMs model the sequence of tags as a Markov process, where the probability of a tag depends on the previous tag. The Viterbi algorithm is often used to find the most likely sequence of tags.
Advantages: Efficient and can handle ambiguity by considering the entire sequence of tags.
Disadvantages: Requires a large, tagged corpus for training; limited by the Markov assumption (only considers a fixed number of previous tags).
**--Maximum Entropy Models:**
Description: These models estimate the probability of a tag based on various features of the word and its context, allowing for more flexibility than HMMs.
Advantages: Can incorporate a wide range of contextual information; more accurate than HMMs in many cases.
Disadvantages: Computationally intensive; requires careful feature selection.

**3. Transformation-Based Tagging (Brill Tagging):**
Description: This approach combines rule-based and statistical methods. It starts with an initial tagging (often using a simple statistical method) and then applies a series of transformation rules to correct the tags. The rules are learned automatically from an annotated corpus.

**4. Neural Network-Based Tagging:**
Description: Neural networks, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are increasingly used for POS tagging. These models automatically learn the features relevant for tagging from large amounts of data, and they can capture complex dependencies between words.

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**
Description: RNNs process sequences of data (like sentences) by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous words, making them suitable for sequential tasks like POS tagging.
Advantages: Can capture long-range dependencies between words; very flexible.
Disadvantages: Can suffer from vanishing gradients, making them hard to train on long sequences.
--> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:
Description: LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem by using memory cells that can retain information over long periods.
Advantages: Better at capturing long-range dependencies than standard RNNs; state-of-the-art performance for many NLP tasks.
Disadvantages: Requires substantial computational resources and large amounts of data for training.

**5. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)**
Description: CRFs are a type of statistical modeling method used for structured prediction. In POS tagging, CRFs model the conditional probability of a sequence of tags given the sequence of words, considering the entire sequence of tags simultaneously.
Advantages: More accurate than HMMs because they can consider a broader range of features and dependencies.
Disadvantages: Computationally expensive to train; requires a large tagged corpus.

**6. Hybrid Approaches**
Description: Many modern systems combine multiple techniques to leverage their strengths. For example, a neural network might be used to generate initial predictions, which are then refined using a CRF.
Advantages: Often achieves the best performance by combining the strengths of different methods.
Disadvantages: Complex to implement and requires careful tuning.

Summary of POS Tagging Techniques:

Rule-Based Tagging: Relies on hand-crafted linguistic rules.
Statistical Tagging: Uses probabilistic models like HMMs and Maximum Entropy.
Transformation-Based Tagging: Corrects initial tags using learned rules (Brill tagging).
Neural Network-Based Tagging: Employs RNNs, LSTMs, and other deep learning models.
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs): Models the sequence of tags as a whole, considering a wide range of features.
Hybrid Approaches: Combines multiple methods to enhance accuracy.
Each of these techniques has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of metho
